Enter CloudEvents, a specification for describing event data in a common way.  CloudEvents seeks to ease event declaration and delivery across services, platforms and beyond!

CloudEvents is a new effort and it's still under active development.  However, its working group has received a surprising amount of industry interest, ranging from major cloud providers to popular SaaS companies.  Our end goal is to offer this specification to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://serverless.us11.list-manage.com/pages/track/click?u=b4fad36768cab222f88338995&id=59a5aec830).
